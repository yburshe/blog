          Website to download a user's Steam library games in a .CSV file and
          view their statistics
        </p>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Being an achievement hunter I had to frequently check on my gaming backlog. I wanted
          a list of games I owned on Steam in a popular file format so that I
          could import the list directly into an app like Notion or Microsoft Excel.
          While developing an app for that, I added features such as the ability
          to check the library of any public user and also see the playtime of
          the games.
        </p>
        <h2>Technologies used</h2>
